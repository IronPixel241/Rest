# RESTful API Project

This project is a RESTful API designed to provide access to resources similar to the AskVerse web application. It allows users to interact with mock data related to questions, answers, and users through HTTP requests.

## Features

- **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Operations:** The API supports CRUD operations for managing mock questions, answers, and user data.
- **Resource Endpoints:** API endpoints are provided for accessing specific resources such as questions, answers, and user profiles.
- **Authentication:** Secure authentication mechanisms ensure that only authorized users can access and modify data.
- **Validation:** Input data is validated to ensure consistency and integrity.
- **Error Handling:** Proper error handling mechanisms are implemented to provide informative responses for client-side errors.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** Employed as the backend runtime environment for handling server-side logic.
- **Express.js:** Used to build the RESTful API framework, simplifying the process of defining routes and handling HTTP requests.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `node server.js` or `npm start`.
4. Access the API endpoints using an HTTP client such as Postman or cURL.

## API Documentation
